<h2> 1. Overview</h2>
Understanding data structures is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems. This repository aims to provide a practical and hands-on approach to learning data structures through Python implementations.The implementations in this repository are designed to be clear, concise, and well-documented. Each data structure is implemented as a separate Python module, with accompanying examples and usage instructions.

<h2> 2. Data Structures</h2>
The following data structures are currently included in this repository:<br>
--> Lists/Arrays<br>
--> Linked Lists<br>
--> Stacks<br>
--> Queues<br>
--> Binary Trees<br>
--> Heaps<br>
--> Hash Tables<br>
--> Graphs<br>
--> Tries<br>
This is not an exhaustive list, and more data structures may be added in the future.<br>

<h2> 3. Usage</h2>
To use the data structures in this repository, you can simply clone the repository or download the specific data structure module that you're interested in.Each module is self-contained and can be used independently.After obtaining the desired data structure module, you can import it into your Python code and create instances of the data structure. Each module provides detailed comments and usage examples to help you understand and utilize the data structure effectively.Feel free to explore the individual data structure modules for further information on their usage.

<h2> 4. Contributing</h2>
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or new data structure implementations to add, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. 
Make sure to follow the established coding style and include appropriate tests and documentation.

<h2> 5.License</h2>
